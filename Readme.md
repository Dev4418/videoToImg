## Description 📝

The "videoToImage" project is a simple Python script that reads a video file, extracts each frame, and saves them as individual image files. This can be useful for various applications such as creating image datasets from videos or generating frames for further processing.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Before using this script, ensure you have the following:

- Python 🐍: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website.

- OpenCV 📸: The project relies on the OpenCV library to handle video processing. You can install it using the following command:

  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python
  ```
## Installation ⚙️

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script directly.

2. Make sure you have fulfilled the prerequisites mentioned above.

## Usage 🚀

1. Run the script videoToImage.py using the following command:

  ```bash
  python videoToImage.py
  ```
##  

2. You will be prompted to enter the path of the video you want to convert. Provide the full path, including the file extension (e.g., .mp4, .avi, etc.).


3. The script will create a folder named "data" in the same directory where the script is located. If the folder already exists, the script will use it.


4. The frames of the video will be extracted and saved as individual image files in the "data" folder. Each image file will be named as "frame0.jpg", "frame1.jpg", and so on.


5. Once all frames are extracted, the script will terminate automatically.
